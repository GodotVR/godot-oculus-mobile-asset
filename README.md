# Godot Oculus Mobile GDNative module

GLES2
-----
It is highly recommended to use the GLES2 renderer available in Godot when targetting these devices. 

Using the main viewport
-----------------------
The ARVR server module requires a viewport to be configured as the ARVR viewport. If you chose to use the main viewport an aspect ratio corrected copy of the left eye will be rendered to the viewport automatically.

You will need to add the following code to a script on your root node:

```
var interface = ARVRServer.find_interface("OVRMobile")
if interface and interface.initialize()
	# Tell our viewport it is the arvr viewport:
	get_viewport().arvr = true

	# change our physics fps
	Engine.target_fps = 72
```
